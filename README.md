Online Kotlin Editor
<pre>
I have used spring boot in the backend and React in the frontend. 
The backend application is called KotlinIDE and the frontend application is called client. 
To run both, I have written a script called runKotlinIDE.sh which is located at root of the repository. 

Requirements:
   kotlinc
   java
   maven
   nodejs 

If not installed, install them with:
   sudo apt install snapd
   sudo snap install --classic kotlin
   
   sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
  
   sudo apt install maven 
  
   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash - 
   sudo apt install nodejs 
  
Then run the script with: 
  ./runKotlinIDE.sh 
  
</pre>
