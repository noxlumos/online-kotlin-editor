Online Kotlin Editor
<pre>
I have used spring boot in the backend and React in the frontend. </br>
The backend application is called KotlinIDE and the frontend application is called client. </br>
To run both, I have written a script called runKotlinIDE.sh which is located at root of the repository. </br>
For this script to work, maven and nodejs should be installed. </br>
If not installed, install with: </br>
  sudo apt install maven </br>
  curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash - </br>
  sudo apt install nodejs </br>
Then run the script with: </br>
  ./runKotlinIDE.sh </br>
</pre>
